            <p>Click on the canvas to add points. Adjust the delay between frames using the input field below.</p>
            <p>The color of points indicates the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="blue"></span> Blue: Points that are not being processed at the current step</li>
                <li><span class="green"></span> Green: The Point that is being currently processed as a part of the Outermost Loop</li>
                <li><span class="magenta"></span> Magenta: The Point that is being currently processed as a part of the Loop at the second level</li>
                <li><span class="yellow"></span> Yellow: The Point that is being currently processed as a part of the Innermost Loop</li>
                <li><span class="red"></span> Red: Points that are pinned on the boundary of the current circle</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the point being processed at the current step has dashed lines around it, it means that the point lies outside the current circle.</p>
